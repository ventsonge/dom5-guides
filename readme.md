# Dominions 5 Guides

This repository contains a number of guides aimed at breaking down certain conceptual aspects in order to teach players how to make informed decisions about how to approach mostly multiplayer games within Dominions 5. All guide content is intended to be viewed in your browser. Downloading the repository can give you access to offline, plain-text copies, but all images, links, and formatting will fail to render.

The repository is ordered by guide type and language and is open to contribution.
 
If you have any questions or comments, feel free to post an issue on github, or contact me on discord. I can be found on the Dominions 5 English Community server.
